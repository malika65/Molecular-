Molecular gastronomy, the scientific discipline concerned with the physical and chemical transformations that occur during cooking. The name is sometimes mistakenly given to the application of scientific knowledge to the creation of new dishes and culinary techniques.A program was proposed for molecular gastronomy that took into account the fundamentally important artistic and social components of cooking as well as the technical element.
