var content_main = '<h1>Molecular gastronomy</h1><p>Molecular gastronomy, the scientific discipline concerned with the physical and chemical transformations that occur during cooking. The name is sometimes mistakenly given to the application of scientific knowledge to the creation of new dishes and culinary techniques.</p><div style="float:left;"><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/518ea9e4e4b0eb1ecff22776/518ea9e5e4b0eb1ecff2277a/57d6be92893fc00f2daf0fff/1534789902750/shutterstock_450233011.jpg?format=1500w" height="275" width="400" alt="Molecular fish"/></div><p>The scientific discipline—which was introduced under the name molecular and physical gastronomy and later shortened to molecular gastronomy—was established in 1988 by Hervé This, a physical chemist, and Nicholas Kurti, a former professor of physics at the University of Oxford, who were interested in the science behind the phenomena that occur during culinary processes. Although food science had existed for some centuries, its focus had historically been on the chemical composition of ingredients and on the industrial production and nutritional properties of food. Molecular gastronomy, on the other hand, focuses on the mechanisms of transformation that occur during culinary processes at the level of domestic and restaurant cooking, an area that had historically tended to rely heavily on tradition and anecdotal information. Molecular gastronomy seeks to generate new knowledge on the basis of the chemistry and physics behind culinary processes—for example, why mayonnaise becomes firm or why a soufflé swells. One side goal is to develop new ways of cooking that are rooted in science. These techniques are called molecular cooking, whereas the new culinary style based on such techniques is called molecular cuisine.</p><h1>Theoretical Foundations</h1><p>A program was proposed for molecular gastronomy that took into account the fundamentally important artistic and social components of cooking as well as the technical element. A distinction was also made between the parts of recipes: “culinary definitions”—descriptions of the objective of recipes—and “culinary precisions”—the technical details of a recipe. Thus, a program for molecular gastronomy emerged: first, to model recipes, or culinary definitions; second, to collect and test culinary precisions; third, to scientifically explore the artistic component of cooking; and, finally, to scientifically explore the social aspects of cooking.</p><p>In giving a name to the new study, Kurti and This looked to the definition of gastronomy given by Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, author of Physiologie du goût (1825; The Physiology of Taste): “the intelligent knowledge of whatever concerns man’s nourishment.” The adjective molecular was added to further define that branch of science, which includes elements of physics, chemistry, and biology.</p><div style="float:right;"><img src="https://splice-bio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Molecular_gastronomy_science_s.jpg" height="275" width="400" alt="Sushi cooked with molecular kitchen"/></div><p>Beginning in 1988, research teams were established in the field of molecular gastronomy at universities in several countries—including France, the Netherlands, Ireland, Denmark, Italy, Spain, and the United States—and the number of such nations continued to increase, reaching more than 30 in the early 21st century. New research laboratories were being created often for scientific research or for university education. Educational initiatives were also introduced within the main framework of physical chemistry education, such as the Experimental Cuisine Collective, launched in 2007 at New York University.</p><p>Molecular gastronomy was shown to be an excellent educational tool, allowing students in chemistry, physics, and biology to observe and understand the practical use of the theories that they learned. In fall 2010 Harvard University debuted a new course on science and cooking taught in part by Catalan chef Ferran Adrià.</p><p>Among many other results, in 2002 a formalism now called “disperse systems formalism” (DSF) was introduced in order to describe the organization and material of food in particular but also of all formulated products (including drugs, cosmetics, and paintings), and new analytic methods were introduced for the study of the transformation of foods either in isolation or in aqueous solutions such as broths and stocks.</p><h1>Historical Precedents And Development</h1><p>Molecular gastronomy has famous ancestors. These include 18th-century chemist Claude-Joseph Geoffroy, who studied essential oils in plants; 18th-century French chemist Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier, who studied meat stock and is celebrated as one of the founders of modern chemistry; American-born British physicist Sir Benjamin Thompson, count von Rumford, who developed modern theories regarding heat and was also interested in meat cooking; German chemist Friedrich Christian (Fredrick) Accum, whose A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons (1820) raised awareness of food safety; and 19th-century French chemist Michel-Eugène Chevreul, who analyzed the chemical composition of animal fats. In the 20th century, French microbiologist Édouard de Pomiane published best-selling books on cooking, notably the influential La Cuisine en dix minutes; ou, l’adaptation au rhythme moderne (1930; French Cooking in Ten Minutes; or, Adapting to the Rhythm of Modern Life), though some criticized the work for confusing science, technology, and technique.</p><div style="float:right;"><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/89/143089-050-E6390DD7/Grant-Achatz-Alinea-recipe-Chicago-blowtorch-sous.jpg" height="300" width="420" alt="Molecular cooker"/></div><p>Molecular gastronomy developed very quickly after its creation in 1988, but about 1999 it was determined that different names had to be applied to distinguish the scientific activity on the one hand from the culinary enterprise on the other. The name molecular cooking (and its variations molecular cookery) was introduced to refer to the kind of technologically oriented way of cooking that was developed by some of the world’s top chefs. Proposed just before 2000, this new terminology gained momentum, and by 2010 it was established that the term molecular gastronomy should only be used to designate the scientific discipline that investigates the mechanisms of phenomena that occur during culinary transformation, whereas the term molecular cooking and its variations should be used to describe the culinary trend in which chefs use “new” tools, ingredients, and methods developed through research in molecular gastronomy. Molecular cuisine is used for designating a culinary style using the new techniques.</p><div style="float:left;"><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/30/172030-050-857B7951/soup-dumplings.jpg" height="355" width="380" alt="Plate with dish"/></div><p>Yet the use of the word new in itself was problematic. Tools such as laboratory filters (for clarification), decanting bulbs (used in skimming stocks), vacuum evaporators (for making extracts), siphons (for producing foams), and ultrasonic probes (for emulsions) were not new in chemistry laboratories. Gelling agents such as carrageenan, sodium alginate, and agar were certainly not entirely new in the food industry. Liquid nitrogen (used to make sherbets and to flash freeze almost anything) had been proposed for use in the kitchen as early as 1907. None of those tools or ingredients, however, was present in cookbooks as recently as the 1980s. Indeed, it was an objective of Kurti and This to rationalize culinary activity as well as to modernize it (for example, to improve the efficiency of some traditional heating systems, in which the energy loss regularly reached 80 percent).</p><p>Molecular cooking was perfected by such noted chefs as Adrià and Andoni Luis Aduriz in Spain, Denis Martin in Switzerland, Ettore Bocchia in Italy, Alex Atala in Brazil, René Redzepi in Denmark, Sang-Hoon Degeimbre in Belgium, Heston Blumenthal in the United Kingdom, and, much later, Thierry Marx in France.</p><div style="float:right;"><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/91/143091-050-A9258ECC/Ferran-Adria-Catalan-one-exponents-Molecular-Cooking-2010.jpg" height="300" width="420" alt="Molecular cooker"/></div><p>In the United States, Fritz Blank, a former clinical microbiologist, opened the Philadelphia restaurant Deux Cheminées (closed 2007). At his restaurant wd~50 (closed 2014) in New York City, Wylie Dufresne invented such singular creations as deep-fried mayonnaise and noodles made with protein (such as shrimp) instead of flour. In Chicago chefs Homaru Cantu at Moto and Grant Achatz at Alinea devised such innovations as edible ink and paper and dishes nestled on aromatic pillows, respectively. Even chefs who did not specialize in molecular cooking introduced into their menus spherification (liquids that create their own spherical “skin” through gelling agents), culinary foams (popularized by Adrià), and flash-frozen popcorn balls, among other concoctions.</p><p>The spread of molecular gastronomy inspired various trends, notably “note-by-note cooking,” which was introduced by Hervé This in the mid-1990s and gained popularity in the ensuing decades. This style uses only pure compounds—such as water, ethanol, and glucose—rather than traditional food ingredients (plants and animals). It is for food the equivalent of synthetic music.</p><div class="container"> <footer class="page-footer font-small blue pt-4"> <div class="container text-center text-md-left"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-6 mt-md-0 mt-3"> <hr class="clearfix w-100 d-md-none pb-3"> <br><h3 class="text-uppercase" class="foo">Molecular gastronomy</h3> <p>Lets cook it together</p></div><div class="col-md-3 mb-md-0 mb-3"> <hr class="clearfix w-100 d-md-none pb-3"> <h5 class="text-uppercase">Links</h5> <ul class="list-unstyled"> <li> <a href="http://www.theperfectspotsf.com/wp02/2010/04/01/the-latest-12/">The most popular molecular gastronomy restaurant</a> </li><li> <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/biography-of-chef-ferran-adria-1664996">There most popular chef-cooker</a></li></ul> </div></div></div></footer></div>'

Tell your kids they’re gummy veggies. Or not, and keep them for yourself and pretend you’re at a super-classy, highly-exclusive modernist cuisine restaurant in New York with your significant other. Or just slurp them in your sweatpants. We don’t care. And we won’t tell.</p><h1>The Science Behind It:</h1> <p> Agar Agar and Gelification. Agar-agar is a substance derived from red algae that when used in recipes acts as a stabilizing and thickening agent due to its ability to create gel shapes (like caviar and spaghetti) out of the liquefied versions of the foods it’s mixed in, according to Molecule-R. Like gelatin, gelling only occurs with agar-agar when a solution containing it has cooled after being boiled. Unlike the animal-based gelatin (Jello), however, an agar-agar based gel is pretty heat resistant once the gel forms. Agar gels will stay solid even after reaching 185 degrees Fahrenheit, while solid pieces of Jello melt at 99 degrees. Gelification is the molecular change of a liquid food to a solid, jelly-like food.</p><div style="float:left;"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vt34q4TVFyY/hqdefault.jpg" height="375" width="400"/></div><h1 class="ingredients">Ingredients:</h1> <p>2 cups of Arugula</p><p>3/4 cups of water</p><p>1/2 tsp. of Agar Agar powder</p><p>Plastic syringe and tube</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><h1>How to Make It:</h1> <p>1- Blend arugula, peeled shallot and water in a blender to obtain a very smooth liquid. Add salt and pepper to taste. If you have a Thermomix, use it for this recipe. First, its high speed blending capabilities will result in a very smooth liquid. Second, you can then dissolve the agar agar by heating the liquid in the Thermomix. And finally, you can mantain the temperature of the preparation high enough so it doesnt solidify while you are filling silicone tubes.2- Get ready the silicone tubes of 0.5 cm in diameter and 2 m long and 1 syringe with a nozzle 0.3 cm in diameter ready. Read Agar Agar Spaghetti if this is your first time making agar agar spaghetti.3- Put the liquefied arugula in a saucepan, dissolve the agar agar and bring it to the boil, stirring constantly with a beater. If using a Thermomix, just set the temperature to "varoma".4- Take off the heat and skim to eliminate any impurities. If using a Thermomix, reduce the temperature to 104°F/40°C to prevent it from solidifying while you fill the syringes and the tubes.5- Fill the syringe and with it fill the tubes, which will have been rolled and secured with a little adhesive tape for greater comfort.6- Submerge the full tubes in cold water so that the liquefied arugula sets in a few minutes.7- With an empty syringe, inject air into the tube to obtain the spaghetto. This is probably the most difficult part of the recipe unless you have an ISI Whip with the Agar Spaghetti adaptor (read Agar Agar Spaghetti for tips and more information on the Agar Spaghetti Kit). The resulting spaghetti can be served hot or cold.</p><div class="container"> <footer class="page-footer font-small blue pt-4"> <div class="container text-center text-md-left"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-6 mt-md-0 mt-3"> <br><h3 class="text-uppercase">Molecular gastronomy</h3> <p>Lets cook it together</p></div><div class="col-md-3 mb-md-0 mb-3"> <h5 class="text-uppercase">Links</h5> <ul class="list-unstyled"> <li> <a href="http://www.theperfectspotsf.com/wp02/2010/04/01/the-latest-12/">The most popular molecular gastronomy restaurant</a> </li><li> <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/biography-of-chef-ferran-adria-1664996">There most popular chef-cooker</a> </li></ul> </div></div></div></footer> </div></div>'

Well, maybe instead of just firing up the grill again on an already sweltering day why not get your fix in a more refreshing way? Why not add smoke to your favorite beers? You could brew your own beer with smoked malts. But in the interest of saving time, why not go the molecular gastronomy route and use a handheld food smoking device known as a smoking gun. It’ll add the flavor of smoke to your store-bought beer without the heat or having to brew your own beer.</p><h1>The Science Behind It:</h1><p> A molecular gastronomy gadget called “The Smoking Gun.” The Smoking Gun coats your food with a surface-level infusion of smoky flavor. The way it works is you load the gun up with your favorite flavored wood chip or aromatic herb and you light it. Once the the chips burn, the gun creates and releases a cooled smoke that can infuse foods without heating or overcooking them. This is ideal for food and beverages you normally want to keep cold like beer or butter.</p><div style="float:left;"><img src="http://www.molecularrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/resized/smoked-beer-smoking-gun-725.jpg" height="375" width="400"/></div><h1 class="ingredients">Ingredients:</h1><p>A bottle of your favorite beer</p><p>Smoking Gun device</p><p>Mesquite wood chips</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h1>How to Make It:</h1><p> Pour your beer into a glass.

Dehydration is the process of drawing moisture (water) out of food in an effort to preserve or dry up its surface, according to Molecular Gastronomy: Exploring the Science of Flavor by Herve This. Traditionally, this technique been used primarily for preserving a surplus of foods like herbs or for more convenient snacking (like dried fruit). In molecular gastronomy, however, dehydration is also used to create crunchy textures, flavor powders or preserve the crispiness (and flavors) of foods like Kahlua-infused Rice Krispies. Dehydration can be performed using a dehydrator or a common household oven, provided that the oven can be set to temperatures below 200 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><div style="float:left;"><img src="https://www.sugarandsoul.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cocoa-puff-white-russian-cocktail-recipe-2-500x500.jpg" height="375" width="400"/></div><h1 class="ingredients">Ingredients:</h1> <p>1/2 cup of half and half</p><p>1/2 cup of Kahlua liquor</p><p>1/8 cup of Rice Krispies cereal</p><p>1/2 tsp. of sugar</p><p>1/4 cup of vodka</p><br><br><br><br><br><h1>How to Make It:</h1> <p> You’ll want to make the Kahlua-infused Krispies ahead of time for this crunchy cocktail. Toss the cereal with 1/4 cup of the Kahlua liquor in order to coat, then in a dehydrator (or an oven on its lowest setting), dehydrate the Kahlua-coated cereal for one hour. Repeat the aforementioned step for another coat of Kahlua. Depending on your dehydrator or oven you may need to leave the cereal in it overnight to complete the drying/crisping process.Once you have the cereal infused with the Kahlua, you can move on to the “milk” part. Combine ice, vodka and sugar in a cocktail shaker and shake until the sugar has dissolved. Strain the vodka/sugar and pour and stir it into the half and half. When ready to serve, pour Kahlua Krispies into a bowl and add half and half/vodka/sugar mixture.

With these raviolis, you can see what’s inside and then once you pop them in your mouth, they pop, release their intense flavors and disappear. It’s like a magic trick in your mouth and you have Chef Ferran Adria of el Bulli to thank for it.</p><h1>The Science Behind It:</h1><p>Soy lecithin found in the edible film disc ravioli wrappers. You’ve probably seen this name on a million ingredient labels. It’s an emulsifier, a substance that takes a liquid and turns it into a foam, which in turn enables the mixture of other substances that otherwise would not mix, like oil and water. Soy lecithin is derived from soybean oil which contains phospholipids. Phospholipids are chemical compounds that can dissolve in both fat and water, a characteristic that’s particularly helpful when you’re trying to mix oil and water found in sauces like mayonnaise and hollandaise.Also, lecithin is a substance that is found in the membranes (thin, flexible outer layer) of every cell of every living thing, which is probably why it was ideal to use it in the manufacturing of the transparent ravioli wrappers (oblates) featured in the recipe below.</p><div style="float:left;"><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bb/a6/e8/bba6e8f76ee5e7314cb40b2624e4c2da.jpg" height="375" width="400"/></div><h1 class="ingredients">Ingredients:</h1><p>Oblates (edible film discs to wrap the raviolis)Your choice of filling (so long as it has low-water content.
